What shall I call you? SehoonPark

| Thanks, SehoonPark. Let's cover a couple of quick housekeeping items before we begin our first
| lesson. First of all, you should know that when you see '...', that means you should press Enter
| when you are done reading and ready to continue.

...  <-- That's your cue to press Enter to continue

| Also, when you see 'ANSWER:', the R prompt (>), or when you are asked to select from a list,
| that means it's your turn to enter a response, then press Enter to continue.

Select 1, 2, or 3 and press Enter 

1: Continue.
2: Proceed.
3: Let's get going!

Selection: 3

| You can exit swirl and return to the R prompt (>) at any time by pressing the Esc key. If you
| are already at the prompt, type bye() to exit and save your progress. When you exit properly,
| you'll see a short message letting you know you've done so.

| When you are at the R prompt (>):
| -- Typing skip() allows you to skip the current question.
| -- Typing play() lets you experiment with R on your own; swirl will ignore what you do...
| -- UNTIL you type nxt() which will regain swirl's attention.
| -- Typing bye() causes swirl to exit. Your progress will be saved.
| -- Typing main() returns you to swirl's main menu.
| -- Typing info() displays these options again.

| Let's get started!

| We will put double quotes around the names of R objects. However, in actual R code, there are
| only a few cases where you will need to put them in quotation marks.

| Let's start by practicing arithmetic operations by using R as a basic calculator.

...

  |============                                                                             |  13%
| How would you type 8 minus 2?

> 8 - 2
[1] 6

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

| How would you square 10?

> sqrt(10)
[1] 3.162278

| That's not the answer I was looking for, but try again. Or, type info() for more options.

| See 'Arithmetic Operations'.

> sqrt(10)
[1] 3.162278

| Try again. Getting it right on the first try is boring anyway! Or, type info() for more options.

| See 'Arithmetic Operations'.

> info()

| Next, we will practice creating objects and giving them names.

...

  |========================                                                                 |  27%
| Try assigning 8 - 2 the name "result".

> result -> 8 - 2
Error: object 'result' not found
> result <- 8 - 2

| That's correct!

  |===========================                                                              |  30%
| Type the name of the object we created above.

> result

| Great job!

  |==============================                                                           |  33%
| We can also give a name to a string of characters.

...

  |=================================                                                        |  37%
| Give the phrase 'social science' the name "course".

> course <- "social science"

| You are amazing!

  |====================================                                                     |  40%
| Notice that spaces are allowed in character strings.

...

  |=======================================                                                  |  43%
| We can also change what a name refers to by assigning a new object to it.

...

  |==========================================                                               |  47%
| Now make "course" refer to 'learning R'.

> course <- "learning R"

| Great job!

  |============================================                                             |  50%
| When we assign an existing object to a new name we always make a copy of it.

...

  |===============================================                                          |  53%
| Assign the value of "result" to "result2".

> result2 <- result

| Excellent job!

  |==================================================                                       |  57%
| Now make "result" name the value of 10 minus 2.

> result <- 10 - 2

| Great job!

  |=====================================================                                    |  60%
| What do you think R will return when we type "c(result, result2)"?

1: a six and an eight
2: an eight and a six
3: a six and a six
4: an eight and an eight

Selection: 2

| Nice work!

  |========================================================                                 |  63%
| Next, we are going to start working with real data: estimates of world population (in
| thousands). A vector of data called "world.pop" has been loaded with this lesson. The first
| element is for the year 1950 up to the last element for 2010.

...

  |===========================================================                              |  67%
| Check what "world.pop" refers to.

> View(UNpop)

| You almost had it, but not quite. Try again. Or, type info() for more options.

| See 'Vectors'.

> world.pop
[1] 2525779 3026003 3691173 4449049 5320817 6127700 6916183

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

  |==============================================================                           |  70%
| Use indexing to look at the 4th element of the "world.pop" vector.

> world.pop[4]
[1] 4449049

| You are doing so well!

  |=================================================================                        |  73%
| Use indexing and concatenation to get just the 1st and 4th elements of "world.pop".

> world.pop[c(1, 4)]
[1] 2525779 4449049

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

  |====================================================================                     |  77%
| Next, we are going to practice using functions.

...

  |=======================================================================                  |  80%
| How would you find the length of i.e., the number of elements in, the "world.pop" vector?

> length(world.pop)
[1] 7

| You got it right!

  |==========================================================================               |  83%
| Create a vector using the sequence function that goes from 1950 to 2010 in increments of 10.
| Assign this vector to an object called "year".

> year <-seq(from = 1950, to = 2010 , by = 10)

| You are amazing!

  |=============================================================================            |  87%
| Use the "year" vector just created to give names to the elements of the "world.pop" vector.

> year
[1] 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010

| You almost had it, but not quite. Try again. Or, type info() for more options.

| See 'Functions'.

> world.pop <- year

| Give it another try. Or, type info() for more options.

| See 'Functions'.

> names(world.pop) <- year

| You got it right!

  |================================================================================         |  90%
| We have included a vector "x" in this lesson. This vector contains 10 integers from 0 to 100.

...

  |===================================================================================      |  93%
| How would you replace the first element in "x" with a missing value?

> x[1]->NA
Error in NA <- x[1] : invalid (do_set) left-hand side to assignment
> x[1]=NA

| Almost! Try again. Or, type info() for more options.

| See 'Functions'.

> x[1] -> NA
Error in NA <- x[1] : invalid (do_set) left-hand side to assignment
> x[1] = NA

| That's not exactly what I'm looking for. Try again. Or, type info() for more options.

| See 'Functions'.
